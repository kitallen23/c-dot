## Blank project

### What I've done:

- Added `.nvmrc`
- Added `jsconfig.json`
- Added `.prettierrc` (and installed prettier as a dev dependency)
- Added a dev env file (in case it's needed), `.env.development`
- Added a no-console rule to eslint config
- Added vanilla extract config for css-in-ts
- Cleared out App.tsx (vite.js provides a default page) and populated it with a basic display of the current time
- Added a basic browser router to `main.tsx`
